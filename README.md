# Image-Text-Recognition
A Python-based OCR project that extracts text from images using Tesseract OCR and image preprocessing techniques.


## Features

- Recognizing text in images (OCR).
- Image preprocessing (binarization, sharpening, grayscale).
- Supports different image formats.
- High accuracy with Tesseract OCR.


## Technologies Used

- Python
- Tesseract OCR: For text recognition.
- Pillow (PIL): For image processing.
- OpenCV: For image preprocessing (binarization, sharpening).
- NumPy: For numerical operations.


## Installation

To run this project, follow the steps below:

1. Install Python 3.8+.
2. Install the necessary libraries by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
